I managed to lock myself out one morning and there was no way of contacting anyone to get back in, but luckily someone Setting up saw me and let me in. My own fault really for having a brain like a sieve, but possibly a buzzer on their door would help. Picking holes though really. It was all great.",

We struggled a bit to eat it, but only because we ate so much the night before! The room was large and inviting and the bathroom clean and sparkly. The outlay was well done, with stairs leading up from the corridor to a bathroom on the right and bedroom on the left. My sister was next door and she had stairs going down. All in all the ambience of the place was lovely and we loved that there were lots of rooms downstairs in the bar/restaurant area which made it feel cosy and welcoming.",

Unfortunately the hotel only use sour dough bread which the children wouldn't eat as it is so hard. In fact my daughter and I didn't eat it either. The sausages were lovely but could have had a bit more colour on them as they didn't look cooked. Only other problem was there was no bath for the children to have the bedtime routine. And after running around all day they really could have done with one. Apart from that we had a good time.",

            "negative": "We had a quick overnight stay in a family room with two adults, our baby and 3yo. There were a few small niggles, which would be easily sorted if you could ring reception from the room, but unfortunately there are no phones in the room and you have to go down to the bar. Not really an option with two small children when you are trying to get them both to bed! - not enough towels provided. Only had towels for two of us, not all four. - two of the smaller lights didn't work so had to have main lights on all the time. - sign in shower advised shower mats available on request. Kind of weird and unnecessary, we just ended up using one of our hand towels. Also, not the end of the world, but the family room we stayed in was not accessible for pram as up and down two flights of stairs. Same for night entrance which is up a flight of steps.",

If I stay again, will try request a room away from near the stairs. It is an older building, so you can expect the creaks. Double bed is actually 2 beds put together, so you can feel the gap, despite the mattress across. Bit disappointing when you book and expect a double. None of these things spoilt the stay.",

            "negative": "Despite having booked the hotel more than 1 month in advance and having received numerous emails/texts about my upcoming visit, on the day of check in, we received a call from the central reservations team at 10:30am (check in starts at 3pm) to say yeah we don't have your family room do you need one? Well yes that's why I booked it, I said I could take a different room provided I could fit in a travel cot as I was travelling with a 3month old baby and had no choice as we had to attend a wedding that day, if I'd known sooner I could of tried to book elsewhere. Also it isn't made clear anywhere until I turned up that there is no lift so we had to lug the baby, travel cot and pram all up the stairs. The room/floor also slopes which makes placing items on the table slightly awkward. I just wanted to say however again the staff at the actual hotel couldn't have been more helpful however providing some tap water so I could make up the babies feeds.",

The bed very comfy. We ate in the dining room for each night of our stay and the food was mostly good, staff friendly and efficient. The breakfast was a bit bizarre as there was only a cooked choice! No cereal, fresh fruit or yoghurt and no continental version. The cooked choices were very good in fairness. It\u2019s the first hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in anywhere in the world offering a \u201cgood breakfast\u201d but having no choice of cereal, fruit, yoghurt the basics of a \u201cgood breakfast\u201d. The chef is on duty so no reason why not. On enquiry we were told \u201cwe don\u2019t do that\u201d! Overall though a pleasant stay and we would stay there again.",
            "negative": "Not having a cereal, fruit, yoghurt choice at breakfast. See above for overall comments. During our stay there were quite a few choices not available on the evening menu and it got worse on the second and third night! Staff were having to constantly apologise to customers. It was not the waiting on staff members problem who were taking the flack but a management problem with ordering and deliveries. The waiting on staff were very apologetic and very sincere and they should be credited for their loyalty. The same happened with the cooked breakfast. Good job we weren\u2019t vegetarians! We did complain. It\u2019s a real shame as the quality, presentation, menu choice is very good and variable until it\u2019s not available!",

The second morning we had juice and hot drinks offered (for the same breakfast price) so it would be good to explain what is included and all breakfast staff ensure guests are asked if they would like juice, hot drinks etc (still not sure if we could ask for a slice of toast with breakfast!). Staff lovely, but would be nice if all acknowledge customers when they approach the bar/serving area.",

The pub serves great food for dinner (I would definitely recommend eating here) and great breakfast. For the price paid, this place has got it right. Just check the location as it was perfect for me who needed to get to the hospital for work (and avoid city centre). I simply parked here and it was an easy 15-20 min walk. Would not hesitate to stay again.",

The room was spotlessly clean, the bed was super comfortable and it was almost silent. we came down for dinner on Friday night and were amazed to find the pub heaving with people as we couldn\u2019t hear a sound from our room! the road was quiet, no disturbance from adjoining rooms. The breakfast was great, The location is great, although on the outskirts of the city, it\u2019s no more than a 30 minute walk to the cathedral. With free parking it worked out as exceptional value overall when compared to other hotels in the centre.",

It didn\u2019t dampen the stay too much but a little more attention to detail with those more minor things would have made the stay amazing.",

The beds very comfortable. The food is just what you expect from a Toby carvery. The hotel is very easy to find and has plenty of car parking at the rear. Buses pass every two minutes to Edinburgh and the airport so ideal place to stay for either.",

Late checkout at 12pm is brilliant as some places you have to be up and out the door by 9-10am! Close to local bus stops/shops for bits and pieces needed and travelling. Easy to book meals/breakfast for duration of stay and staff are happy to offer alternative places to eat if nothing taking fancy off their menu. Would definitely visit again.",
            "negative": "The room was nice, slightly smaller than expected. The double bed was against a wall so only one side accessible and OH had to climb over/shuffle down the bed to get in/out. Also street facing so rather noisy. We found it got very hot during the night. Window is there to open for air (also got a child safety lock/restrictor on it) but then you have the noise from the traffic outside on the main road and people walking by on the street. Investing in AC for the rooms would be good, or decent tower fans especially in the summer when the temperatures are steadily climbing. I'd imagine summer months would be unbearably hot in smaller rooms like that. All in that was it really.",

We had a view out our window to the houses across the road, which doesn't sound glamourous, but it's better than the opposite rooms which would be looking into the hotel carpark. The barman who checked us in was very friendly and allowed us to keep our car parked there the following day once we had checked out, so we could enjoy Edinburgh during the day before our drive into the Scottish Highlands. The hotel itself is located half way between the city centre and Edinburgh International Airport, and is situated on a main road. This means, there's 4 different bus routes going into the city centre and the wait for each is no longer than 5 minutes. This makes the location very convenient.",

We already loved it here ( have been coming here for years) but were so impressed with all the work that's been done throughout the bar, restaurant and public areas. Bedrooms are really modern too now with new comfy beds and supersoft pillows which were a godsend as my only gripe over the years was that the beds were so uncomfortable and the pillows were lumpy meaning i woke up with aching bones, but not anymore. Everywhere is spotless, bright and freshly decorated. We honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else in Edinburgh as this place ticks all the boxes for us. It's also only 20 mins on the number 26 Lothian Bus into the Capital and the bus stop is right outside the front door. The lounge bar is so relaxing and cosy with a really nice ambience and a nice new touch is that they are dog friendly and have a little station set up in the bar with a basket of dog blankets and jars of dog biscuits \ud83d\udc15 The buffet breakfast is spot on with plenty of choice and constantly being replenished. Staff are amazing, helpfull and friendly as always. We have never had a bad stay here and cannot wait to book up again. Thanks again 'Team Toby'",

Location is right next to a busy dual carriageway. Not an issue for us really as the room was well soundproofed but could be a problem for light sleepers! These small issues did not detract from our stay.",

Tried to open windows to let in some cooler air but sash was broken so had to use a shoe to wedge window open an inch so I did not roast in the night. This was the only thing that spoiled my stay but it was significant enough to make it very uncomfortable. Tried to smother the radiator with towels to reduce the heat which helped a little but not enough! Would stay again if they fix the heating and not try and heat up planet earth!",

There was no cereals or fruit and yoghurt and the menu only had 5 items on and one of those was not available. Even after asking for a slight change to part of one of the breakfasts that was not done and both breakfasts were cold and dry. Fried eggs stuck together, solid and cold, sausage not edible and all other items cold. Suffice to say we didn't eat it. Giving a decent breakfast is not difficult and the final part of the stay sort of let the whole stay down.",

Breakfast was disappointing, although a good selection of cooked items - had to ask where to find the juice/cereals, all seemed a bit haphazard. The handles on the spoons to self serve the breakfast items were really greasy - so much so, that I had to go get two more napkins to wipe my hands down before handling my own cutlery. Sounds pedantic when I write it down, but trust me, you could have cooked sausages on the handle of the beans spoon in particular!",
